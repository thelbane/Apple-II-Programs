## 2020 Two-Liner Contest Submission

Lo-res breakout-style game implemented in just two lines of Applesoft. Requires joystick or paddle to control.

Dev Note: This game is not winnable in its current state. The ball doesn't support "paddle English" and can therefore get stuck in a pattern that will never hit any bricks. This was a conscious sacrifice I made in order to get it to fit into two lines, but I'm with you on this one... it's frustrating.
