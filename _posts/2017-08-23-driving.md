Buckle up! It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

Press the spacebar to activate hyperjets and jump over the obstacles. This game features high-quality 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound[^1] that will make your neighbors call the cops.

[^1]: Clicks. It clicks the Apple II speaker. It sounds nothing like a real car. It's all lies.
