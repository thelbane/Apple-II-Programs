# Content Tone & Style

When writing content for this Apple II Programs site, follow these guidelines:

## Voice

- **First person**: Use "I" throughout
- **Casual and conversational**: Write like you're talking to a fellow enthusiast
- **Self-deprecating humor**: Don't take yourself too seriously ("like fourteen people who really digs this retro stuff")
- **Playful**: Have fun with it ("8-bit portal to the spectral plane", version names like "aka 'It works!'")

## Technical Writing

- **Accessible but not dumbed down**: Explain complex concepts clearly, but trust the reader's intelligence
- **Show your work**: When breaking down code, walk through the logic step by step
- **Acknowledge the hacky nature**: These are one/two-liners; embrace the cleverness and weirdness

## Emotional Notes

- **Nostalgic but not saccharine**: Reference the magic of early computing without overdoing it
- **Genuine enthusiasm**: Let your passion for Apple II programming show through
- **Humble**: You're sharing, not lecturing

## Examples

❌ "This algorithm optimizes tile position calculation."
✅ "Here's where things get a little weird..."

❌ "The program implements a standard sliding puzzle mechanic."
✅ "Controls are I, J, K, and L (all CAPS) to slide tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively."
