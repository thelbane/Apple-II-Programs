# Applesoft BASIC Facts

Quick reference for Applesoft behavior to avoid common mistakes.

## Boolean Expressions

- **True = 1**, False = 0 (not -1 like some other BASICs)
- Example: `X = (A = B)` sets X to 1 if A equals B, 0 otherwise

## Common Memory Locations

- **POKE 184**: Program counter (low byte). Used for conditional branching within a line.
- **POKE 50**: Text mode. 255 = normal, 63 = inverse.

## Variable Defaults

- Uninitialized numeric variables default to 0
- Uninitialized string variables default to empty string ""
