Apple II rockstar, Chris Torrence, recently updated his excellent Apple2TS emulator to make it fall-off-a-log easy to load and run Applesoft programs over the web! Thanks to these enhancements, you'll find that most programs on my site now have a handy "Try me in Apple2TS!" link.

{% include img.html src="/assets/images/post/launch-emulator.png" caption="Wow! Instantly run these programs!" alt="Illustration depicting that clicking 'Try me in Apple2TS' launches and runs the program in an emulator." %}
<!--more-->

Tapping or clicking on this link will open Apple2TS in a new tab, paste the Applesoft program, and run it. If the program is tagged as running slow on a 1MHz machine, then it will run in "warp" mode in the emulator.

Give it a try here:
{% capture source_code -%}
0HGR2:FORN=1TO114:A=ASC(MID$("L77L.M77TM77TM>>^MCC_GCC@.//M/O@CCWNM@ZAB]N<?_M0J.JPK.BDXN//M/O:@ZJPJP:DD.L0J.:@@.:DDNNMM7D.<M?\<M?XMM2I.@EKW.EQE1",N,1))-46:FORM=0TO4:B=A/2:B%=B:HCOLOR=3*(B%<B):A=B%:HPLOTX,M*2TOX,M*2+1:NEXT:X=X+(1+A)*2:NEXT
{%- endcapture %}{% include applesoft.md src=source_code %}

I'd like to send a big thank you to Chris for adding these enhancements and being open to my feedback.
