Someday, I'll fit a whole procedurally generated world into one or two lines of Applesoft, but until I get good, we'll have to settle for one building.

I'm not gonna lie. My goal was to draw a house instead of a factory, but my drawing routine has a strong bias towards drawing symmetrical stacks of boxes. Houses with nice curb appeal don't generally look like stacks of boxes, so went for something more industrial. I also briefly considered turning it into a birthday cake.


### Side Note:

Going forward, programs will be dated based on when I get around to posting them to this site, and not when I originally shared them elsewhere (e.g., the Apple II Enthusiasts Facebook group). This feels sloppy and inconsistent with how I've been doing it up until now, but saying it out loud makes me feel better about it.
