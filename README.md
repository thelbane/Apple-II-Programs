# Apple II Programs
This is a collection of [short programs](short-programs) I've written for the Apple II. Most of them are one- or two-liners, written just for fun and shared to the [Apple II Enthusiasts Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/5251478676/).

Coming soon (probably): A disk image!

## Usage
Copy and paste these programs into your favorite Apple II emulator _or_ enter them into your actual Apple II and type `RUN`. Then sit back and watch the magic happen... slowly... because Applesoft is slow.
