# Apple II Programs
This is a collection of [short programs](short-programs) I've written for the Apple II. Most of them are one- or two-liners, written just for fun and shared to the [Apple II Enthusiasts Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/5251478676/).

## Usage
Copy and paste these programs into your favorite Apple II emulator _or_ enter them into your actual Apple II and type `RUN`. Then sit back and watch the magic happen... slowly... because Applesoft is slow.

If you're feeling extra lazy, here's a [disk image](short-programs/short-programs.dsk) containing all of the above programs in a single, easy-to-use package.

## Community
Thank you for being one of the like fourteen people who really digs this retro stuff (aka The vibrant Apple II community). If you have any problems with the programs in this repo, please let me know by opening an issue. I'm also aware that my one- and two-liners are very hacky and difficult to parse out. If there's a particular program you'd like to understand better, but you've hit a roadblock, let me know (in an issue) and I'll try to make time to add detailed dev notes. Cheers!
