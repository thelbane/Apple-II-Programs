# Community
Thank you for being one of the like fourteen people who really digs this retro stuff. If you have any problems with the programs in this repo, please let me know by creating an issue. I'm also aware that my one- and two-liners are very hacky and difficult to parse out. If there's a particular program you'd like to understand better, but you've hit a roadblock, let me know and I'll try to make time to add detailed dev notes.
